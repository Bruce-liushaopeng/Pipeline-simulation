//possible events

1. inspector 1 start to inspect c1 [ins1c1_start]

2. inspector 2 start to inspect c2/c3 [ins2c2_start] or [ins2c3_start]
	before: inspector2 finished inspecting last component
			randomly choose a c2 or c3 to inspect. (hard code to be switch to one another each time)
	post: create event of c2/c3 being produced

3. inspector 1 finished inspecting c1 [ins1c1_end]
	before: this is being created by ins1c1_start
	post: check if buffer are available, 
			if avilable increment of buffer size  && create event for WorkStation1 && create event for [ins1c1_start]

	before: this is being created by ins1c1_start
	post: check if buffer are available, 
			if avilable increment of buffer size;

5. Workstation 1 start to produce part1 [w1_start]
	before: this event is created by [ins1c1_end]
